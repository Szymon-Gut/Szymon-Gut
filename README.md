I am also running a project about predicting different types of activities based on smartphone's activity (Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist). Based on this our task is to predict which activity  is currently being performed.
