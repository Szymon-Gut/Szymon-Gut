### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on the second year of Data Engeneering and Analysis on Warsaw Unversity of Technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning focused the most on tree models but not only
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m Python, R and Java programmer. I am looking for bigger projects to develop my skills and build solid portfolio. If you are looking for second year student without commercial experience feel free to hit me on LinkedIn (link below).
- âœ¨ On my profile you can see some of projects done for classes at my University.
- Currently I'm working on predicting house pricing in Montreal and preparing search paper about predicting house prices using Tree based models. 
- I am also running a project about predicting different types of activities based on smartphone's activity (Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist). Based on this our task is to predict which activity  is currently being performed. 
- I have also done dashboard about our Facebook account, where you can upload necessary data and you will get precise analysis. 
- You can notice also a poster about Greenhouse Gases Emission because I find this topic necessary to stop polluting the environment (whole poster was done in R). 
- You can see also a raport about good practises in data visualizations which was made for one class on my University. I decided there to do Covid-19 data visualization because of huge popularity of this topic. There were plenty covid statistic's visualizations which were not easy to interpret as they should be.
