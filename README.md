# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Szymon - a data engineering and analysis student at Warsaw University of Technology. Currently, I'm working on my engineering thesis focusing on Curriculum Learning. As part of this project, I've created a package called academia-rl, which is available on PyPI.

## Projects

### 1. academia-rl
I am currently working on an engineering project exploring Curriculum Learning. As a result, the [academia-rl](https://pypi.org/project/academia-rl/) package was developed to facilitate advanced machine learning usage.

### 2. toRpEDA
In addition to the academia-rl project, my GitHub account also includes the toRpEDA package written in R. It is a tool for automatic data exploration, simplifying data analysis in the R language.

### 3. Big Data & Data warehouses
Within my portfolio, you'll find projects related to Big Data, where we analyzed data from platforms such as StackOverflow and Data Science StackExchange. Additionally, I participated in a data warehouse project where we designed the warehouse, created an ETL pipeline, and conducted data analysis from the Central Statistical Office (GUS) using buisseness inteligence tools like PowerBI.

### 4. Machine Learning and Dashboards
Apart from that, I have experience in projects related to machine learning and building interactive dashboards for data analysis, for example, using data from the Facebook platform.

## Open to New Projects
I am open to new challenges and projects, especially those related to Big Data, data warehouses, data lakehouses, and machine learning. Feel free to explore my repositories to learn more about my skills and experience.

I am eager to collaborate, so if you have an idea for an interesting project, let me know! ðŸš€
