# Hi I'm Simon! ðŸ‘‹
! am data engineer with passion to machine learning, deep learning and mathematics. 
## Projects

### 1. academia-rl
It is my biggest project so far. This project is ready to use python package for using and invesigating impact of Curriculum Leanrning in Reinforcement Learning tasks. Package is avaible on PyPi: [academia-rl](https://pypi.org/project/academia-rl/) and was created with two my collegues as our Bachelor degree thesis on Warsaw University Of Technology.

Github repository: https://github.com/krezelj/academia

### 2. toRpEDA
In addition to the academia-rl project, my GitHub account also includes the toRpEDA package written in R. It is a tool for automatic data exploration, simplifying data analysis in the R language. This is a group project conducted on Advanced R course on Warsaw University Of Technology.

### 3. Big Data & Data warehouses
Within my portfolio, you'll find projects related to Big Data, where we analyzed data from platforms such as StackOverflow and Data Science StackExchange. Additionally, I participated in a data warehouse project where we designed the warehouse, created an ETL pipeline, and conducted data analysis from the Central Statistical Office (GUS) using buisseness inteligence tools like PowerBI.

### 4. Machine Learning and Dashboards
Apart from that, I have experience in projects related to machine learning and building interactive dashboards for data analysis, for example, using data from the Facebook platform.

Dashboards:
- Facebook analysis (python): [Facebook-Dashboard](https://github.com/Szymon-Gut/picipolo_DASHboard)
- Nobel prizes analysis (R):
  - Github: https://github.com/Szymon-Gut/DashBoard
